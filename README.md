This project contains 5 major milestones where each step was built incrementally.
This project simulates a movie title search engine that allows a client to connect to
a server using IP networking and HTTP protocol. This project also supports a multi-threaded
server for higher search efficiency.

The first four milestones aim at exploring important functions of the search engine,
while the final project milestone combines these functionality with IP networking and
multi-threading.
