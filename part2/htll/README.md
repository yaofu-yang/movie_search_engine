# HTLL

The goal with this part of the assignment is to build a hashtable using an existing LinkedList implementation. 
Since we don't want your success to hinge on the perfection of the previous assignment, we are providing a library 
for you to use, LinkedList.o. 

Unfortunately, some people are having issues with the LinkedList library. 

Please try this: 

* run ```make```; if everything works, great!
* If make complains about a -fPIC PIE something or other, copy LinkedList.o from the libs directory into the htll 
directory, and try again. 
* If you want, you can copy your LinkedList.c into this directory and compile it into a .o file with ```gcc -c LinkedList.c```.
  - If you take this path, please don't copy your .h files into this directory. 
  
* If none of the above work for you, please drop us a note on Piazza. Tell us what did or didn't work.
